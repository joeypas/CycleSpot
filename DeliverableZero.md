# Description
---
CycleSpot integrates navigation with local bike infrastructure, prioritizing bike-safe routes and destinations with available parking for bikes. Being a navigation app, it will revolve around a map giving the user quick information on pumps and bike shops, including directions for when repairs are needed in a pinch. In addition, as a social aspect, we give the user the ability to rate and mark different locations they have visited, as well as share routes with friends if time allows. 

# Use Cases
---
1. Seeing where bike parking/public bike infrastructure is at a glance with map overlays
  - We will be using the Burlington, VT, open city data to construct these locations on a map and create routes 
3. Navigating to these locations of interest, while prioritizing bike safe routes
4. Social aspect: Rating different marked locations, user profiles with past reviews, maybe Reddit karma-like rankings
   3a. Possibly tracking routes that users have taken in the past (if time permits)
